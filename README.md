# Nim Launcher

> A simple, fast, and highly configurable application launcher for Linux (X11) written in pure Nim. Inspired by Rofi, designed for personal use and customization.

## Features

*   **Fuzzy Search:** Instantly filters applications as you type.
*   **Keyboard Navigation:** Fully controllable with the keyboard (arrow keys, Enter, Escape).
*   **Borderless & Centered:** Appears as a clean, undecorated window in the center of your screen.
*   **Extremely Fast Startup:** Uses an intelligent cache that only re-scans for applications when they actually change.
*   **Highly Configurable:** Almost every aspect of the look and feel can be customized via a simple INI file.
*   **Lightweight:** No heavy GUI toolkit dependenciesâ€”just a direct interface with X11.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to build and run the launcher on your system.

### Prerequisites

You will need the Nim compiler and the standard X11 development libraries.

1.  **Install Nim:** Follow the official instructions at [nim-lang.org](https://nim-lang.org/install.html).

2.  **Install X11 Development Libraries:**
    *   **Arch / Manjaro / CachyOS:**
        ```bash
        sudo pacman -S libx11
        ```
    *   **Debian / Ubuntu / Pop!_OS:**
        ```bash
        sudo apt-get install libx11-dev
        ```
    *   **Fedora / CentOS:**
        ```bash
        sudo dnf install libX11-devel
        ```

### Building

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd nim_launcher
    ```

2.  **Install Nim dependencies:** The project requires the `x11` wrapper. Nimble will install it for you.
    ```bash
    nimble install x11
    ```

3.  **Compile the launcher:** We recommend building with the `-d:release` flag for maximum performance.
    ```bash
    nim compile -d:release scr/nim_launcher.nim
    ```
    This will create a `nim_launcher` executable inside the `scr/` directory. You can move this executable to a location in your `$PATH` (e.g., `~/.local/bin/`) for easy access.

## How to Use

### Launching

This program is designed to be launched via a hotkey managed by your Window Manager (like i3, Sway, bspwm) or Desktop Environment (like GNOME, KDE).

For example, in i3 you would add this to your config file:
`bindsym $mod+d exec /path/to/your/nim_launcher`

### Controls

The launcher is controlled entirely with the keyboard:

*   **Start Typing:** Begin typing to fuzzy search for an application.
*   **Up/Down Arrows:** Navigate the list of results.
*   **Enter:** Launch the selected application.
*   **Escape:** Close the launcher immediately.
*   **Clicking Away:** If you click on another window, the launcher will automatically close (as it has lost focus).

## Configuration

On the first run, the launcher will automatically create a default configuration file at:
`~/.config/nim_launcher/config.ini`

You can edit this file to customize nearly every aspect of the launcher.

## Future Plans

This project is functionally complete, but here are some ideas for future improvements:

*   **Font Rendering:** Use a library like `Xft` to allow for custom TTF fonts and sizes.
*   **Icon Support:** Display application icons next to their names.
*   **Advanced Fuzzy Search:** Implement a more powerful algorithm that can handle typos.

> A simple, fast, and highly configurable application launcher for Linux (X11) written in pure Nim. Inspired by Rofi, designed for personal use and customization.

## Features

- **Fuzzy Search:** Instantly filters applications as you type.
- **Keyboard Navigation:** Fully controllable with the keyboard (arrow keys, Enter, Escape).
- **Borderless & Centered:** Appears as a clean, undecorated window in the center of your screen.
- **Extremely Fast Startup:** Uses an intelligent cache that only re-scans for applications when they actually change.
- **Highly Configurable:** Almost every aspect of the look and feel can be customized via a simple INI file.
- **Built-in Themes:** Choose from popular color schemes like Nord, Dracula, Solarized, Gruvbox, Catppuccin, and more.
- **Lightweight:** No heavy GUI toolkit dependenciesâ€”just a direct interface with X11.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to build and run the launcher on your system.

### Prerequisites

You will need Nim compiler and X11 development libraries only if you want to build from source.

1. **Install Nim:** Follow the official instructions at [nim-lang.org](https://nim-lang.org/install.html).

2. **Install X11 Development Libraries:**
   - **Arch / Manjaro / CachyOS:**
     ```bash
     sudo pacman -S libx11
     ```
   - **Debian / Ubuntu / Pop!\_OS:**
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install libx11-dev
     ```
   - **Fedora / CentOS:**
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install libX11-devel
     ```

### Build or Run

- You can **run the precompiled binary** included in the repository root (if available).
- Or **build from source** by cloning the repo and compiling:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DrunkenAlcoholic/nim_launcher.git
cd nim_launcher
nimble install x11
nimble build -d:release
```

This produces a nim_launcher executable you can move to your $PATH for easy access.

## How to Use

### Launching

This program is designed to be launched via a hotkey managed by your Window Manager (like i3, Sway, bspwm) or Desktop Environment (like GNOME, KDE).

For example, in i3 you would add this to your config file:
`bindsym $mod+d exec /path/to/your/nim_launcher`

### Controls

The launcher is controlled entirely with the keyboard:

- **Start Typing:** Begin typing to fuzzy search for an application.
- **Up/Down Arrows:** Navigate the list of results.
- **Enter:** Launch the selected application.
- **Escape:** Close the launcher immediately.
- **Clicking Away:** If you click on another window, the launcher will automatically close (as it has lost focus).

## Configuration

On the first run, the launcher will automatically create a default configuration file at:
`~/.config/nim_launcher/config.ini`

You can edit this file to customize nearly every aspect of the launcher.

## Future Plans

This project is functionally complete, but here are some ideas for future improvements:

- **Font Rendering:** Use a library like `Xft` to allow for custom TTF fonts and sizes.
- **Icon Support:** Display application icons next to their names.
- **Advanced Fuzzy Search:** Implement a more powerful algorithm that can handle typos.
